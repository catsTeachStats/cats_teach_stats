- Class: text
  Output: Hello world

  
- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we are going to learn a bit about variable types and plotting variables  
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Did you watch a video of William Plumer Jacobs booping a particle (ball) in his accelerator (cat toy)?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: 'Watch the video at the provided link and count how many boops he makes with each paw' 

- Class: text
  Output: You just dealt two groups of variables--type of boop (left or right paw) and boop counts
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Are the boop counts an example of a dependent (response) variable or an independent (explanatory) variable?
  AnswerChoices: dependent (response); independent (explanatory)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="dependent (response)")
  Hint: 'A dependent, also called a response, variable is a variable that is predicted or affected by another variable. An independent, sometimes called an explanatory, variable is a variable that affects or explains changes in the response variable.'
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Is the type of boop (left paw or right paw boop) an example of a dependent (response) variable or an independent (explanatory) variable?
  AnswerChoices: dependent (response); independent (explanatory)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="independent (explanatory)")
  Hint: 'Think about the answer to the previous question and how it relates to this question.'
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now that we know what variables we are working with, we are going to try explore how to visualize that data you collected.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Visualizing data is important because it adds to our understanding of how the data related to one another and can aid in other analyses.
  
- Class: text
  Output: One type of plot is a BAR PLOT. In this plot, categories appear on one axis and the value for each category is used to determine the height of the bar for that category.
  
- Class: figure
  Output: Here is a bar plot indicating how many times a friend (not me) ate cake and gelato this month.
  Figure: example_bar_plot.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the bar plot, does my friend probably like to eat cake or gelato more?
  AnswerChoices: cake;gelato
  CorrectAnswer: gelato
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'gelato')
  Hint: Don't you just love Italian desserts?
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now you are going to create your own bar plot
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In the R console, assign to the variable "right" the number 21, an example of right paw boops counted.
  CorrectAnswer: right <-21
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='right <- 21')
  Hint: Type right <- 21 in the console. Don't forget that R is case sensitive.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now assign to the variable "left" the number 24, an example of the left paw boops counted.
  CorrectAnswer: left<-24
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='left<-24')
  Hint: Type left <- 24 in the console
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To create your bar plot, type barplot(c(right,left))
  CorrectAnswer: barplot(c(right,left))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='barplot(c(right,left))')
  Hint: Type barplot(c(right,left)) in the console at the command prompt.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Add labels for each bar by typing in axis(side=1,at=c(1,2),labels=c("right","left"))
  CorrectAnswer: axis(side=1,at=c(1,2),labels=c("right","left"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='axis(side=1,at=c(1,2),labels=c("right","left"))')
  Hint: Type axis(side=1,at=c(1,2),labels=c("right","left")) at the command prompt.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The "axis" command means that we are dealing with the axes. The "side=1" refers to the x-axis. The "at" part means at the x tick marks 1 and 2. The lables are the labels for those tick marks.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To add in the x-axis label, type mtext("paw",side=1)
  CorrectAnswer: mtext("paw",side=1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mtext("paw",side=1)')
  Hint: Type mtext("paw",side=1).  Remember that R is case sensitive
