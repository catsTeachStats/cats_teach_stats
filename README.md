# Cats Teach Stats

Cats are the purrrrfect stats teachers, and everyone loves watching cute animal videos online. Cats Teach Stats brings you lesson modules for teaching data analysis in introductory biology and experimental biology courses. Students watch adorable cat videos, collect data from them, form hypotheses, and test those hypotheses using statistics in an interactive environment. Modules are available either through a Shiny app or a more in-depth SwirlStats lesson in the program R.

## Getting Started

Please enjoy our feature film, WPJ and the Particle Accelerator, which pairs with the Shiny app and the Swirl lesson. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW9Lmh3D4cY&feature=youtu.be) to watch it on YouTube. 

Stay tuned for updates when we officially launch our Shiny app!
